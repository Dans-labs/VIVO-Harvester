With the class files uncompressed / unpackaged a large part of the installation is complete. 

The first step is to ensure that you have all the necessary tools for execution.
IF you plan on using the scripts there are configuration files that need to be configured under the config directory.
 
Necessary Tools for Execution
To execute the VIVO harvester, you need the following things:
* An Installation of VIVO to read from and write to
* A mysql database to use for Storing Jena Models
* Java (unless the VIVO installation is on another computer this should exist.)

Necessary Libraries for building
This project uses Maven to build the necessary libraries into the project jar.  If you are wishing to modify the files and re build the jar you will need Maven installed.

Usage

There are two ways to run the VIVO Harvester either as command-line tools (useful in a bash script) or use it as a Java library. We'll cover both ways.

Command-Line
All the Harvester tools, when used via the command-line share some common parameters and parameter formats. General information about the Harvester tools on the command-line can be found at Harvester Tools.

Bash Scripts
The first thing you should do is open your Environment Config File ( scripts/env ) and make sure everything is in order. Next you should look at your vivo configuration file (config/model/vivo.xml) to make sure this points to your VIVO installation. You can check out our example scripts or our walk throughs for how to create a bash file using the environment file.
