PubmedFetch - Fetches data from the Pubmed servers
-----
PubmedFetch sends a query off to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ to get data back from Pubmed.  The query is in exactly the format as would
be put into the web form at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/, and the data returned is the same results, except in XML format.  In
order for this data to be usable, a translation must be made between it and VIVO's RDF/XML format.  This can be done via the XSLTranslator
tool packaged with Harvester.

    <Param name="a">b</Param>

    <!-- 
    Wordiness - How much should be displayed on the console when the fetch is run.  Options range from nothing at all to errors only to general
    information to more detailed debugging information.
    -----
    Allowable values:
    OFF - No log information is displayed on the console.
    FATAL - Only fatal errors are displayed on the console.
    ERROR - All error messages are displayed. 
    WARN - Error and warning messages are displayed.
    INFO - Errors, warnings, and general user information is displayed.  This is the default.
    DEBUG - Errors, warnings, general information, and information intended for debuggers is displayed to the console.
    TRACE - All of the above as well as even finer-grain debugging information is displayed.
    ALL - Everything that goes into the log is displayed on the console.
    
    Values meaningful for PubmedFetch:
    ERROR: All runtime errors are categorized as ERROR, so none will be shown for FATAL
    INFO: Start and end of fetch run, number of results returned by query, range of records being fetched in a given batch operation
    DEBUG: Query text sent to Pubmed, start and end of result buffering and buffer size, start and end of sanitize step, plus length of XML file
           pre- and post-sanitize
    TRACE: Very fine-grain details, such as start and end of I/O operations

    <!--
    SearchTerm - The search query to be sent to Pubmed.  The query is in exactly the format as would be put into the web form at
    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/, and the data returned is the same results, except in XML format.
     -->
    <Param name="a">b</Param>

    <!--
    NumRecords - The maximum number of publications to be returned.  This affects the request sent to Pubmed's servers, so it can be used to help
                 manage Internet traffic volume.
     -->
    <Param name="a">b</Param>

    <!--
    BatchSize - The amount of publications in each batch.  If this is less than NumRecords and the query results size, multiple fetches will be made
                to the server to grab each chunk of data.
     -->
    <Param name="a">b</Param>

    <!-- 
    Email - The email address of the person responsible for this install of the program.  This is required by NIH guidelines so the person can be
            contacted if there is a problem, such as sending too many queries too quickly. 
     -->
    <Param name="a">b</Param>

    <!-- 
    RecordDestination - The record handler in which the results of the fetch will be placed, so that other Harvester tools or other programs may operate
                        on the data.
