XPathTool - Runs an XPath query on a file and writes the first result to the console.
-----
XPathTool runs a single XPath query on a specified file, and writes the first result, if any, to the console.  It can be used to parse out
values in configuration files, which can then be placed in command-line scripting variables.  If the file could not be parsed an exception
will be output.  If there was no data nothing will be output.
