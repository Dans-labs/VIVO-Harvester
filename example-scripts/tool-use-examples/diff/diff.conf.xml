<% The mathematical difference is found by removing from the source model the contents of another model. This leaves  %>
<%     in the output model all the triples that are in the source model but not in the removal model.                 %>

<%  wordiness - (optional) sets the lowest level of log messages to be displayed to the console.  The lower the log   %>
