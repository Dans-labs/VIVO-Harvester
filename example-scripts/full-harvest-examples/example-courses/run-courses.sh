#clear old data
# For a fresh harvest, the removal of the previous information maintains data integrity.
#	If you are continuing a partial run or wish to use the old and already retrieved
#	data, you will want to comment out this line since it could prevent you from having
# 	the required harvest data.

# Execute Translate
# This is the part of the script where the outside data, in its flat RDF form is used to
#	create the more linked and descriptive form related to the ontological constructs.
#	The traditional XSL language is used to achieve this part of the work-flow.
