RunBibutils - Runs the Bibutils tool, translating files from various sources into MODS format
-----
Bibutils is a collection of open-source tools which translate files of many different formats into the Library of Congress's
Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) XML format.  This format is supported by a pre-written sample XSLT in the Harvester, thus allowing
Harvester to support all these different formats.  The RunBibutils tool is provided as a convenience to perform batch Bibutils runs on
data coming in from a fetch.
 -->
<Config>
    <!-- 
    Wordiness - How much should be displayed on the console when the fetch is run.  Options range from nothing at all to errors only to general
    information to more detailed debugging information.
    -----
    Allowable values:
    OFF - No log information is displayed on the console.
    FATAL - Only fatal errors are displayed on the console.
    ERROR - All error messages are displayed. 
    WARN - Error and warning messages are displayed.
    INFO - Errors, warnings, and general user information is displayed.  This is the default.
    DEBUG - Errors, warnings, general information, and information intended for debuggers is displayed to the console.
    TRACE - All of the above as well as even finer-grain debugging information is displayed.
    ALL - Everything that goes into the log is displayed on the console.

    Values meaningful for RunBibutils:
    ERROR - All runtime errors are categorized as ERROR, so none will be shown for FATAL
    INFO - Number of records translated by Bibutils, number of records which did not need translation, shell command which executes Bibutils, exit
           of Bibutils with error code
    DEBUG - Console output of Bibutils program being executed
    TRACE - Start of run of Bibutils on an individual record, note if no Bibutils run is needed on an individual record
     -->
    <Param name="Wordiness">INFO</Param>

    <!-- 
    BibutilsBasePath - The directory containing the Bibutils executables.  For a typical Linux apt-get installation, this is /usr/bin. 
     -->
    <Param name="BibutilsBasePath">/usr/bin</Param>

    <!-- 
    SourceFormat - The format of the input data, which Bibutils will convert to MODS.  This actually determines which executable is run, since Bibutils
                   uses a separate executable for each input format.
	-----
	Possible Values:
	bib - BibTeX (this format is used by RefWorks) (executable: bib2xml)
	biblatex - BibLaTeX (executable: biblatex2xml)
	copac - COPAC (executable: copac2xml)
	end - EndNote (executable: end2xml)
	endx - EndNote XML (executable: endx2xml)
	isi - ISI web of science (executable: isi2xml)
	med - Pubmed (executable: med2xml)
	ris - RIS (executable: ris2xml)
     -->
    <Param name="SourceFormat">bib</Param>

    <!-- 
    RecordSource - The record handler from which the input will be pulled.  Bibutils will be executed on this input.  If the input is not already formatted as
                   files, temp files will be created since Bibutils operates on files.
     -->
    <Param name="RecordSource">harvested-data/rh-bibutils-in</Param>

    <!-- 
    RecordDestination - The record handler in which the results of the translation will be placed, so that other Harvester tools or other programs may operate
                        on the data.
     -->
    <Param name="RecordDestination">harvested-data/rh-bibutils-out</Param>

    <!-- 
    Force - Determines whether we want the system to decide if a record needs translation by Bibutils (based on a checksum of the most
            recent record of the same name that was translated) and to skip those which do not need to be translated, for the sake of
            performance
    -----
    Possible Values:
    true - Force, meaning always translate all records
    false - Decide if the record needs translation before translating it
     -->
    <Param name="Force">false</Param>
