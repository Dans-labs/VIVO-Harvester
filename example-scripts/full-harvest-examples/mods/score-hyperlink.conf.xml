Score - provides a method to score incoming data based on how it compares with data already in VIVO.
-
Score takes input data and compares it to data in VIVO, assigning a "score value" to each comparison and placing
that value in a separate Jena model.  The use of Score is intimately tied to the use of Match, which takes these
score values and decides whether it wants to rename incoming data so that it has the same URI as data in VIVO.
