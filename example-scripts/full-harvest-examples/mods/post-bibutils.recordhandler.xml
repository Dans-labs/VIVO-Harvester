RecordHandler - Configuration file for a record handler
-
A record handler is an interface for handling string data.  It is used by Harvester tools for preliminary data work, before the data gets
imported by Transfer into a Jena model for scoring and matching.  Record handlers exist for text files and H2 databases.  For text files,
a directory is specified and each file in that directory is considered a record.  For H2 databases, a database URL is specified and the
record handler uses defaults for table and field names allowing us to work with just the basic string data.
