Model - Configuration file for a Jena model
-
Jena is an open source Semantic Web framework for Java, and a "Jena model" is an RDF graph in Jena.  A configuration
file provides all information necessary for accessing a particular Jena model.  Therefore in Harvester scripts, if
two Harvester tools reference the same model configuration file in their tool configurations, it means they are both
working on the same set of data.
