Match - takes a model generated by Score and renames matches, creates links, or removes literals based on
        the associated scores. 
-
Match uses a threshold value, which is compared with the values for each individual produced by Score to
determine if action should be taken. If the Score value equals or exceeds the threshold, then action is
taken. Typically this action is a rename. A rename means that the matched input is given the same URI as
the individual in VIVO matching it, which identifies the two as the same entity. This can then be merged
into VIVO. In this way an existing individual in VIVO can have more data added to it. For example, a publication
can have a previously missing publisher added to it.
