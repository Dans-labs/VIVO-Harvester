Transfer - Transfers RDF data from one Jena model to another.
-
Transfer allows you to copy RDF data from one location to another.  This is ultimately used for adding data that the Harvester has been
manipulating into VIVO, and also for data transfers during intermediate steps.  It can also be used to pull data from a record handler
(such as an H2 database or RDF/XML text files) into a Jena model, and to output data to a file in RDF/XML format.  Finally, Transfer can
be used to remove existing triples from a Jena model.

    <!-- 
    Wordiness - How much should be displayed on the console when the fetch is run.  Options range from nothing at all to errors only to general
    information to more detailed debugging information.
    -
    Allowable values:
    OFF - No log information is displayed on the console.
    FATAL - Only fatal errors are displayed on the console.
    ERROR - All error messages are displayed. 
    WARN - Error and warning messages are displayed.
    INFO - Errors, warnings, and general user information is displayed.  This is the default.
    DEBUG - Errors, warnings, general information, and information intended for debuggers is displayed to the console.
    TRACE - All of the above as well as even finer-grain debugging information is displayed.
    ALL - Everything that goes into the log is displayed on the console.

    Values meaningful for Transfer:
    ERROR - All runtime errors are categorized as ERROR, so none will be shown for FATAL
    DEBUG - Warning if no output is specified

    <!-- 
    RecordSource - Determines if we are using a file or a Jena model as the input.
    -
    Possible Values:
    File - Use a file as the input.  FileSourceRDF and SourceRDFSyntax becomes required, ModelSource is ignored.
    Model - Use a Jena model as the input.  ModelSource becomes required, FileSourceRDF and SourceRDFSyntax are ignored.

    <!-- 
    FileSourceRDF - The path to the RDF file or the directory containing RDF files used as input.

    <!-- 
    SourceRDFSyntax - The language of the RDF file specified by FileSourceRDF.
    -
    Possible Values:
    RDF/XML - W3C Standard
    RDF/XML-ABBREV - Synonym for RDF/XML
    N3 - Notation3
    TURTLE - Subset of Notation3
    TTL - Synonym for Turtle

    TransferMode - Determine if we want to add or remove triples from the destination Jena model.  If Add is specified, data from the
    source is added to the destination model.  If Remove is specified, any triples in the destination that match triples in the source
    are removed from the destination.
    -
    Possible Values:
    Add - If we are adding the source triples to the destination (standard Transfer)
    Remove - If we are removed the source triples from the destination

    ModelDestination - The name of the Jena model to output triples to (or to remove triples from).

    <!-- 
    FileDestinationRDF - The path to write the output of Transfer to.  Optional.  File will be overwritten if exists, and is always written
