Transfer - Transfers RDF data from one Jena model to another.
-
Transfer allows you to copy RDF data from one location to another.  This is ultimately used for adding data that the Harvester has been
manipulating into VIVO, and also for data transfers during intermediate steps.  It can also be used to pull data from a record handler
(such as an H2 database or RDF/XML text files) into a Jena model, and to output data to a file in RDF/XML format.  Finally, Transfer can
be used to remove existing triples from a Jena model.

    <!-- 
    wordiness - how much should be displayed on the console when the fetch is run.  Options range from nothing at all to errors only to general
    information to more detailed debugging information.
    -
    Allowable values:
    OFF - No log information is displayed on the console.
    ERROR - All error messages are displayed. 
    WARN - Error and warning messages are displayed.
    INFO - Errors, warnings, and general user information is displayed.  This is the default.
    DEBUG - Errors, warnings, general information, and information intended for debuggers is displayed to the console.
    TRACE - All of the above as well as even finer-grain debugging information is displayed.
    ALL - Everything that goes into the log is displayed on the console.

    Values meaningful for Transfer:
    ERROR - All runtime errors
    DEBUG - Warning if no output is specified
