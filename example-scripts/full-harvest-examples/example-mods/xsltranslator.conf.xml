XSLTranslator - translates one XML file to another using a specified XSLT file to describe the translation
-
XSLTranslator is typically used to translate fetched data from its own native format into RDF/XML which can then be placed
into a Jena model and manipulated by other Harvester tools.

    force - determines whether we want the system to decide if a record needs translation (based on a checksum of the most recent record of
            the same name that was translated) and to skip those which do not need to be translated, for the sake of performance.
    -
    Possible Values:
    true - Force, meaning always translate all records
    false - Decide if the record needs translation before translating it
